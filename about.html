        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          I'm a highly motivated and passionate computer science student with a
          strong background in full-stack web development and artificial
          intelligence. Over the last few years, I’ve had the opportunity to
          work on a range of projects, from building real-time dashboards to
          designing interactive websites and apps. My education has been
          complemented by valuable internship experiences at renowned companies
          such as OpenAI, Google, and TechVerse.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've always been drawn to the intersection of technology and human
          experience, and I'm especially interested in how thoughtful design and
          AI can solve real-world problems. As the top student in my class, I’ve
          consistently aimed to go above and beyond both academically and
          practically, earning recognition for academic excellence and
          innovation in student-led tech initiatives.
        </p>

        <p>
          My goal is to continue pushing boundaries by contributing to
          cutting-edge technologies that make life easier, smarter, and more
          connected. I’m excited to grow my expertise and take on new challenges
          in the world of software engineering, AI, and beyond.
